# **Capstone 2 Project: FutBall**

## Project Overview

## Title: FutBall
## URL: https://capstone-2-futball-frontend-6c1740fe1d19.herokuapp.com/

## Features:
- User Authentication: Users can register and login to the website
- Match Data: Users can view match details for current date, past date or for future dates as well.
- Leagues: User can see variety of different competitions/leagues listed

## Why This Feature?
This are the most basic features that a stastistics providing app for football need to have. I plan to add more features like, letting users change and update their profiles and let users add teams or competitons to their favorites. This are some of the few that i have in my mind.

## External API Use
In this app i am using API-FOOTBALL from RapidAPI. When i started this project i was using Football-data.org API but this API lacked some data that i wanted and was also little difficult to fetch data from. The API-FOOTBALL had more data available for me to fetch and was little more userfirnedly.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Heroku
